Optic Recognition of Digits through Machine Learning

The repository contains csv files that were used for the application of Machine Learning algorithms. 
These csv files are divided into training and testing data - divided into 8x8 matrices of pixelized values of the digits. 

The different algorithms that were implemented were:
  1. Decision trees
  2. Neural Networks
  3. Naive Bayes
  4. K-Nearest Neighbors
  5. Boosting
  6. Support Vector Machines

The repository also contains sample codes for the implementation of these algorithms.
